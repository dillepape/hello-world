# hello-world
The time-honored address to the world

Now, I am editing this README some so as to address [issue #1](https://github.com/dillonpape/hello-world/issues/1).  But if I close that issue, possibly accidentally, even though this README is not actually finished, will I be able to reopen the issue?  Hmm â€¦
