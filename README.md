# hello-world
The time-honored address to the world

Now, I am editing this README some so as to address issue #1.  But if I close that issue, possibly accidentally, even though this README is not actually finished, will I be able to reopen the issue?  Hmm â€¦

Ah, so closing and reopening did work successfully.  Unfortunately, I apparently jumped ahead in editing this README in the `master` branch, rather than continuing to read on about branching for such edits.  That problem, however, is being alleviated now.
